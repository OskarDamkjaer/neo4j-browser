# Contributing to Neo4j Browser

## Need to raise an issue?

Where you raise an issue depends largely on the nature of the problem.

Firstly, if you are an Enterprise customer, you might want to head over to our [Customer Support Portal](https://support.neo4j.com/).

There are plenty of public channels available too, though.
If you simply want to get started or have a question on how to use a particular feature, create a post on the [community forum](https://community.neo4j.com/), drop a line to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/neo4j) or ask a question in [Slack](https://neo4j.com/slack).
If you think you might have hit a bug in our software (it happens occasionally!) or you have specific feature request then use the issue feature right here in our GitHub repository.
Check first though as someone else may have already raised something similar.

## Want to contribute?

If you want to contribute a pull request, we have a little bit of process you'll need to follow:

- Do all your work in a personal fork of the original repository
- [Rebase](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request), don't merge (we prefer to keep our history clean)
- Create a branch (with a useful name) for your contribution
- Include unit tests if appropriate (obviously not necessary for documentation changes)
- Take a moment to read and sign our [CLA](https://neo4j.com/developer/cla). 
 
We can't guarantee that we'll accept pull requests and may ask you to make some changes before they go in.
Occasionally, we might also have logistical, commercial, or legal reasons why we can't accept your work but we'll try to find an alternative way for you to contribute in that case.
